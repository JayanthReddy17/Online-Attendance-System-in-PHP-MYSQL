# Online-Attendance-System-in-PHP-MYSQL 
The aim of the project is to develop a sophisticated system for managing attendance, benefiting teachers, students, and college administration through full automation. 
This system is crafted with scalability and code reusability as primary considerations, enabling easy modification by adjusting variables to achieve specific outcomes.
Additionally, it offers flexibility for incorporating additional features without disrupting existing ones. 
This adaptability is facilitated by employing Object-Oriented Programming, a modular approach to designing web services, and adhering to significant aspects of the MVC model.
Consequently, it becomes feasible to extend the project to mobile applications and other platforms.
